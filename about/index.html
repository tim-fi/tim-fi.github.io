	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Tim Fischer, I'm a 21 year old software engineer and computer science bachelor student at the University of Tübingen. I live in south-western Germany, to more specific in the county of Böblingen, about 30 minutes south of Stuttgart and 20 mintues north of Tübingen. I work at my university in the work group <a href="https://www.wsi.uni-tuebingen.de/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens">Methods of Machine Learning</a>, and at a small company called <a href="https://mecodia.de">mecodia</a>. At both I work as a full-stack webdeveloper. In my free time I do many things, for the most part I code around a bit, playing with some side projects from time to time. But the rest of the time I spend hanging out with some friends and doing gymnastics.</p>
