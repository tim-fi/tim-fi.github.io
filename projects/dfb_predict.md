# [dfb_predict](https://github.com/tim-fi/dfb_predict)
This was a graded group project from university, the jist of it was that we needed to develop an application to predict game in the DFB 1.Liga,
the german football league. It encompased everything from data collection and processing, match prediction using stochastic methods, and UI development
for an easy to use interface.
