## [Talks.Tue](https://github.com/talks-tue/talks.tue.flask)

This is the project I currently work on at my University. It is meant to be a small web-app for managing all of the talks that take place around the CS-department of the university and the [MPI for Inteligent Systems branch in TÃ¼bingen](https://is.tuebingen.mpg.de/).
